<p>With 12+ years of experience in the digital marketing industry, I've worked with SMB to enterprise level brands in a wide variety of industries. While comfortable managing ads across all major platforms, I'm particularly intrigued with the crossover between analytics and PPC.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Sr. Search Marketing Strategist for M&T Bank, where I lead paid media efforts for retail checking and savings products.</p>

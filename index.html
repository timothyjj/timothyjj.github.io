<p>I'm a paid media marketer with over a decade of experience in the digital marketing industry. With both agency and in-house experience, I've worked with a wide range of industries ranging from SMB to enterprise ad spend levels. While I'm well-versed in platforms across the spectrum of online advertising, I find myself particularly drawn to the crossover between analytics and advertising. I enjoy sharing knowledge with the industry at large through writing and speaking.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Sr. Search Marketing Strategist for M&T Bank, where I oversee paid digital advertising for retail checking and savings products.</p>

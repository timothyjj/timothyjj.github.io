            <h1>Timothy Jensen</h1>
            <h2>Web Strategist &amp; Photographer</h2>
            <p>Based in upstate New York, I enjoy helping others (and myself) get the most out of the web. With experience ranging from online advertising management to in-depth data analysis, I've worked in the digital marketing industry since 2008, when I began to dabble in SEO. Through the course of my career, I've come to focus primarily on online advertising and analytics, while also mastering basic web development.
            </p>
            <p>Besides working in the online world, I also enjoy capturing the physical world around me with photography. Whether carrying my DSLR or my iPhone, I'm always looking for potential scenic shots or candid photos. When time allows, I'm outside hiking up a mountain or biking on a local trail.</p>

<p>With 12+ years of experience in the digital marketing industry, I've worked with SMB to enterprise level brands in a wide variety of industries. While comfortable managing ads across all major platforms, I'm particularly intrigued with the crossover between analytics and PPC.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Sr. Search Marketing Strategist for M&T Bank, where I'm responsible for leading paid media efforts for retail checking and savings products.</p>

<p>You can find articles I've written on <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/author/tim-jensen/" target="_blank">Search Engine Journal</a>, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/author/tim-jensen" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/tim-jensen/" target="_blank"> Smashing Magazine</a>, and the <a href="http://www.clixmarketing.com/blog/" target="_blank">Clix Marketing blog</a>. I've also spoken at conferences such as SMX (Search Marketing Expo) and periodically join webinars and podcasts.</p>

            <h1>Timothy Jensen</h1>
            <p>I enjoy making the web work for others and myself. With experience ranging from online advertising management to data analysis, I've worked in the digital marketing industry since dabbling in SEO in 2008. More recently, I've been learning to code for the web.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy capturing the world around me in images. Whether carrying my DSLR or my iPhone, I'm always looking for potential scenic shots or candid photos.</p>

<p>With close to a decade of experience in the digital marketing industry, I've worked with SMB to enterprise level clients in a wide variety of industries. While comfortable managing ads across all major platforms, I'm particularly intrigued with the crossover between analytics and PPC.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Campaign Manager for <a href="http://clixmarketing.com">Clix Marketing</a>.</p>

<p>You can find articles I've written on <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/author/tim-jensen/" target="_blank">Search Engine Journal</a>, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/author/tim-jensen" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/tim-jensen/" target="_blank"> Smashing Magazine</a>, and the [Clix Marketing blog](http://www.clixmarketing.com/blog/). I've also spoken at conferences such as SMX (Search Marketing Expo) and periodically join webinars and podcasts.</p>

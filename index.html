            <h1>Timothy Jensen</h1>
            <p>I enjoy helping others (and myself) get the most out of the web. With experience ranging from online advertising management to in-depth data analysis, I've worked in the digital marketing industry since 2008, when I began to dabble in SEO. More recently, I've been learning to code for the web beyond the basics of HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>Besides working in the online world, I also enjoy capturing the physical world around me with photography. Whether carrying my DSLR or my iPhone, I'm always looking for potential scenic shots or candid photos.</p>

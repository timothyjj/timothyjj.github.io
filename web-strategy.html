                Both as a department lead in a full-service agency setting and as an independent consultant, I&rsquo;ve helped countless small to medium sized businesses execute strategy to see a return from the web. While my current role as Director of Digital Strategies at <a href="http://overit.com" target="_new">Overit</a> focuses primarily on web advertising, including search, display, social, and video placements for a variety of industries, my work experience includes search engine optimization, web analytics, and content writing as well. My goal is to assist business decision makers in finding the best mix of paid and earned media to reach their target audiences, while implementing the proper data tracking to evaluate success. I also possess a moderate knowledge of front-end web development, with a solid grasp of HTML/CSS, an ongoing effort to learn JavaScript, JQuery, and PHP, and extensive experience customizing WordPress sites.

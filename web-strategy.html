            <h2>PPC, SEO, Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                Both as a department lead in a full-service agency setting and as an independent consultant, I&rsquo;ve helped countless small to medium sized businesses execute strategies to deliver a return from the web. While my current role as Senior Strategist at <a href="http://overit.com" target="_new">Overit</a> focuses primarily on web advertising&mdash;managing search, display, social, and video placements&mdash;my work experience includes search engine optimization, web analytics, and content writing as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to help business decision makers find the best mix of paid and earned media to reach their target audiences, while implementing the proper data tracking to evaluate success. I also possess a moderate knowledge of front-end web development, with a solid grasp of HTML/CSS, an ongoing effort to learn JavaScript, JQuery, and PHP, and extensive experience customizing sites built in templates such as WordPress.

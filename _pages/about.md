With close to a decade of experience in the digital marketing industry, I've worked with SMB to enterprise level clients in a wide variety of industries. While comfortable managing ads across all major platforms, I'm particularly intrigued with the crossover between analytics and PPC.

Currently, I work as a Campaign Manager for [Clix Marketing](http://clixmarketing.com).

You can find articles I've written on [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/author/tim-jensen/), [Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/author/tim-jensen), [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/tim-jensen/), and the [Clix Marketing blog](http://www.clixmarketing.com/blog/). I've also spoken at conferences such as SMX (Search Marketing Expo) and periodically join webinars and podcasts.
